## About
Following [Africa Kenyah](https://github.com/codingtherapist)’s [webAccessibilityStudyGroup](https://github.com/codingtherapist/webAccessibilityStudyGroup), this is a way for me to document as I learn about Digital Accessibility as well as a prep for the [IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) Certification](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification).

## Changelog
**09 AUG 2024**: The next [WAS Certification Exam](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certification-apply) is on 13 November - 4 December, and applications close 20 November (17:00 EDT).
