# Accessibility Fundamentals

## Types of Disabilities


### Blind

#### Design Considerations
- Content present through text or text alternatives
- Information must not be conveyed by visual attributes alone
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Content must use markup with good structure and semantics
- Custom controls must have the correct name/label, role, and value
  - Must also change value when appropriate
- Users must receive audio feedback after all actions
- Videos require audio description (if original audio does not explain everything shown)
- On mobile:
  - All features require a click action
  - Custom swipe actions will not work with a screen reader on


### Low-Vision

#### Types of Low-Vision
- **Blur**: Objects appear blurry, difficulty to distinguish
- **Blur with Low Contrast**: Blurry, difficult to distinguish borders or texts
- **Cataracts**: Blind spots and/or innumerable dark grey spots in vision
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Floating dark spots
- **Glaucoma**: Edges are darkened or lost, only small area can be seen, and no peripheral vision
- **Hemianopia**: Limits vision to left or right side of the eye
- **Macular Degeneration**: Loss of vision in the centre of vision
- **Retinal Detachmen**: Flashes of light, floaters, shadowing of vision

#### Zoom Text
- One tool for magnification
- Provides up to 36x power
- Text/Image smoothing
- Change colours (inverted, yellow on black, custom)
- Pointer enhancements (larger, coloured, with a circle or cross-hair)
- Focus on text entry
- Focus enhancements (when using no or default focus styles)
- Mouse tracks zoom, as well as built-in screen reader

#### Design Considerations
- Pinch to zoom must not be disabled
- All text must pass contrast guidelines
- Links, buttons, and controls must have visible focus and hover states
- UI must have clear distinction between content and controls


### Colour Blindness
- Red-green colour blindness is the most common form
	- Deuteranopia and protanopia are two subtypes
- Tritanopia is blue-yellow colour blindness
- Achromatopsia is insensitivity to all colours
- Red and black can be difficult to distinguish from each other

#### Design Considerations
- Do not use colour alone to communicate information
- There are no assistive technologies to aid with colour blindness
- All information must be understandable without needing to distinguish between colours


### Deaf
- Main concern on the web is accessibility of audio/video content
- Transcripts should contain all sounds required for context (applause, signals)
- Transcripts are not sufficient for video content because they are not synchronised
- Captions should be synced
- Transcripts are useful for those who canâ€™t keep up with the video or deafblind users

#### Design Considerations
- All videos must have captions
- All audio-only content must have transcripts
- Sign language interpretation can be very helpful


### Deafblind
- Use braille displays to use the computer/read text

#### Design Considerations
- All of the considerations for blindness apply
- All of the considerations for deafness apply
- A transcript for audio/video content must be provided
