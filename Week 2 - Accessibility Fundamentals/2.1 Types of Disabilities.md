# Accessibility Fundamentals

## Types of Disabilities


### Blind

#### Design Considerations
- Content present through text or text alternatives
- Information must not be conveyed by visual attributes alone
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Content must use markup with good structure and semantics
- Custom controls must have the correct name/label, role, and value
  - Must also change value when appropriate
- Users must receive audio feedback after all actions
- Videos require audio description (if original audio does not explain everything shown)
- On mobile:
  - All features require a click action
  - Custom swipe actions will not work with a screen reader on


### Low-Vision

#### Types of Low-Vision
- **Blur**: Objects appear blurry, difficulty to distinguish
- **Blur with Low Contrast**: Blurry, difficult to distinguish borders or texts
- **Cataracts**: Blind spots and/or innumerable dark grey spots in vision
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Floating dark spots
- **Glaucoma**: Edges are darkened or lost, only small area can be seen, and no peripheral vision
- **Hemianopia**: Limits vision to left or right side of the eye
- **Macular Degeneration**: Loss of vision in the centre of vision
- **Retinal Detachment**: Flashes of light, floaters, shadowing of vision

#### Zoom Text
- One tool for magnification
- Provides up to 36x power
- Text/image smoothing
- Change colours (inverted, yellow on black, custom)
- Pointer enhancements (larger, coloured, with a circle or cross-hair)
- Focus on text entry
- Focus enhancements (when using no or default focus styles)
- Mouse tracks zoom, as well as built-in screen reader

#### Design Considerations
- Pinch to zoom must not be disabled
- All text must pass contrast guidelines
- Links, buttons, and controls must have visible focus and hover states
- UI must have clear distinction between content and controls


### Colour Blindness
- Red-green colour blindness is the most common form
	- **Deuteranopia** and **Protanopia** are two subtypes
- **Tritanopia** is blue-yellow colour blindness
- **Achromatopsia** is insensitivity to all colours
- Red and black can be difficult to distinguish from each other

#### Design Considerations
- Do not use colour alone to communicate information
- There are no assistive technologies to aid with colour blindness
- All information must be understandable without needing to distinguish between colours


### Deaf
- Main concern on the web is accessibility of audio/video content
- Transcripts should contain all sounds required for context (applause, signals)
- Transcripts are not sufficient for video content because they are not synchronised
- Captions should be synced
- Transcripts are useful for those who can’t keep up with the video or deafblind users

#### Design Considerations
- All videos must have captions
- All audio-only content must have transcripts
- Sign language interpretation can be very helpful


### Deafblind
- Use braille displays to use the computer/read text

#### Design Considerations
- All of the considerations for blindness apply
- All of the considerations for deafness apply
- A transcript for audio/video content must be provided


### Motor Disabilities
- A range of physical experiences
- Can use a variety of software/hardware options

#### Design Considerations
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Links, buttons, and controls must have a visible focus state and should have a visible hover state
- Warn users before time expires and provide method to extend, ensure warning allows for slow responses
- Provide large click targets


### Speech Disabilities

#### Types of Speech Disability
- **Stuttering**
- **Cluttering**: Rapid speech that may be inconsistent in rhythm and lack syntax
- **Apraxia**: Difficulty using muscles to form sounds
- **Dysarthia**: Caused by brain damage, muscles for speech production are impaired, causing slurred speech, slow speech, mumbling
- **Speech Sound Disorders**: Certain sounds are difficult to produce
	- Two types:
		- **Articulation Disorders**: Difficulty in physically producing speech sounds, may be omitted, added, substituted or distorted
		- **Phonemic Disorders**: Difficulty distinguishing speech sounds to determine word meaning (“call”, “tall” may both be pronounced as “tall”)
- **Non-vocal**: Inability to produce sound

#### Communication Options
- **AAC** (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)
	- **Unaided** relies on non-verbal communication like body language, gestures, facial expressions, and sign language
	- **Aided** relies on the use of tools and a user’s body, i.e. communication boards, pen and paper, to electronic devices that produce computer-generated voices

#### Design Considerations
- Don’t depend on voice input


### Cognitive Disabilities
