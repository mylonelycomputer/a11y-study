# Accessibility Fundamentals

## Types of Disabilities


### Blind

#### Design Considerations
- Content present through text or text alternatives
- Information must not be conveyed by visual attributes alone
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Content must use markup with good structure and semantics
- Custom controls must have the correct name/label, role, and value
  - Must also change value when appropriate
- Users must receive audio feedback after all actions
- Videos require audio description (if original audio does not explain everything shown)
- On mobile:
  - All features require a click action
  - Custom swipe actions will not work with a screen reader on


### Low-Vision

#### Types of Low-Vision
- **Blur**: Objects appear blurry, difficulty to distinguish
- **Blur with Low Contrast**: Blurry, difficult to distinguish borders or texts
- **Cataracts**: Blind spots and/or innumerable dark grey spots in vision
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**: Floating dark spots
- **Glaucoma**: Edges are darkened or lost, only small area can be seen, and no peripheral vision
- **Hemianopia**: Limits vision to left or right side of the eye
- **Macular Degeneration**: Loss of vision in the centre of vision
- **Retinal Detachmen**: Flashes of light, floaters, shadowing of vision

#### Zoom Text

#### Design Considerations
